This presentation is hosted on [go-talks.appspot.com](http://go-talks.appspot.com/github.com/rewe-digital/golang-intro/golang-intro.slide).

Given a working Go environment, you need to `go get golang.org/x/tools/cmd/present` and run `present` in this

You can then open the presentation [from your local host](http://127.0.0.1:3999/golang-intro.slide#1).
